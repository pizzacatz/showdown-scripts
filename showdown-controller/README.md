# Showdown Gamepad

Play [Pokémon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/) battles with an
XInput controller (Xbox pad, or DualShock through DS4Windows / Steam Input).
A cursor you move with the D-pad, **A** to confirm, **B** to back out — the
mainline-games feel, layered over the normal web UI.

Mouse and keyboard keep working at all times. The script never decides
anything for you: every button press maps to one click you could have made
yourself. Forfeit needs two presses of Select within 4 seconds.

## Install

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (or Violentmonkey).
2. Open the raw script and accept the install prompt:
   **[`dist/showdown-gamepad.user.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pizzacatz/showdown-controller/main/dist/showdown-gamepad.user.js)**
3. Reload `play.pokemonshowdown.com`. A small pill in the bottom-right corner
   says **🎮 Gamepad: press any button on the controller** — plug in the pad and
   press any button once (browsers hide a pad from pages until its first
   press). The pill turns green (**Gamepad ON — …**) and the orange cursor
   appears as soon as a battle shows controls.

If the pill never turns green after a press: open the console (F12) — the
script logs `[showdown-gamepad] …` lines, including a warning if the pad
reports a non-`standard` mapping. `navigator.getGamepads()` returning only
`null`s means the browser itself isn't seeing the pad (Steam's controller
support can capture it; Chrome is the most reliable).

## Bindings (defaults — remappable)

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| D-pad / left stick | Move the cursor (holds repeat: 400 ms, then every 120 ms) |
| **A** | Confirm / activate the highlighted button |
| **B** | Back — Showdown's *Back* (previous slot / leave target select), *Cancel* while waiting on the opponent, or leave the party list |
| **X** | Jump to the party (switch) list (↓ off the bottom of the moves does the same; ↑ from the party goes back) |
| **RB** | Toggle Terastallize / Mega / Z / Dynamax — an `(RB)` hint sits next to the checkbox |
| **LB** | Skip turn (only while the battle animation is behind) |
| **Y** | Skip to end (same). The playback buttons are also cursor-selectable with A. |
| **Select** | Forfeit — press once to arm (the status pill turns red), press again within 4 s to concede; any other button cancels. In a Bo3 this concedes the current game. An always-on `(Select)` tag sits by the Timer button (or on QoL Battle Tools' Forfeit button if you run that script). |
| **Start** | Turn the whole controller layer on/off |
| **RT** | Close the current Showdown tab (Teambuilder, a finished battle, a chat…). Never closes Home; on a live battle it opens Showdown's own forfeit confirmation instead of leaving silently. |
| **L3 / R3** | Previous / next tab (wraps) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+G` | Same toggle, from the keyboard |

**Remapping:** click the 🎮 status pill (bottom-right) → *Rebind* on any row →
press the controller button you want. Bindings are saved in the browser
(localStorage) and the on-screen hints follow. *Reset defaults* restores the
table above. The settings panel also includes **Show button label pills**;
uncheck it to remove the `(RB)`, `(LB)`, `(Y)`, and `(Select)` labels while
leaving the cursor highlights, borders, and active-group styling in place.
This preference is saved independently in localStorage.

Team preview, move select, doubles target select, forced switches, the
"waiting for opponent" state, the playback buttons and the end-of-battle
screen (Instant replay / Main menu / Rematch) are all covered. Outside a
battle the **main menu's battle group** is navigable — format selector, any
injected quick-select buttons (e.g. Ghost Clicker's Reg M-B / Bo3), team
selector, *Battle!* / *Cancel*, and while you have games running the links
back to them — with wrap-around at the top and bottom. Teambuilder / Ladder /
Watch / Resources are deliberately not on the cursor path. Any Showdown
**popup** (format picker, team picker, confirmations) takes over the cursor
while it's open — **B** closes it.
Disabled moves and active/fainted party slots can be highlighted but never
activated. Upload/download-replay buttons are deliberately not selectable.

The cursor is a two-tone ring (white inside, orange outside) that pulses
gently; a soft orange tray plus an orange *Attack* / *Switch* heading marks
which group you're in; not-selectable buttons (0 PP, active or fainted
Pokémon) are dimmed gray. One accent color, readable on the light and dark
themes — see [`docs/ui-design.md`](docs/ui-design.md) for the reasoning. The
cursor survives Showdown's turn re-renders by identity (it stays on *Protect*,
not on "the third button"), remembers the last move you used across turns,
and never wraps around edges.

While you have text in the chat box the pad is ignored (the empty, auto-focused
chat box does not count). Unplug the pad and you're back to mouse only.

## Layout

```
src/gamepad.js       INPUT — polls the Gamepad API, emits UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT/
                     CONFIRM/BACK/SWITCH_MENU/GIMMICK/TOGGLE_LAYER. No Showdown.
src/cursor.js        NAVIGATION — pure state machine over (pane, index).
                     No DOM, no gamepad. Unit-tested with fake screens.
src/showdown-dom.js  ADAPTER — the only file with Showdown selectors.
                     Reads panes, clicks buttons, paints the cursor, watches
                     re-renders.
src/settings.js      saved bindings + the remap panel (no Showdown knowledge)
src/main.js          wiring + toggle + typing guard + hints + test hook
build.js             esbuild → dist/showdown-gamepad.user.js
test/                vitest (jsdom); fixtures are real client HTML captured
                     by tools/recon.js
tools/recon.js       drives a local Showdown server + headless Chrome through
                     a doubles battle; with --script it runs the built
                     userscript end-to-end against the real client
docs/                PRD and DOM recon notes
```

Why three layers: when Showdown changes its markup (it will), only
`showdown-dom.js` needs touching; the navigation logic stays testable without
a browser.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm test          # unit tests (80)
npm run build     # dist/showdown-gamepad.user.js
npm run recon -- --script dist/showdown-gamepad.user.js   # e2e vs a LOCAL server
```

The recon/e2e tool needs a local Showdown server (sim on :8000, classic
client on :8081 with `/showdown` proxied) and Chrome at
`/usr/bin/google-chrome` (`--chrome`, `--url` to override). It never talks to
the public server. Its stage snapshots land in `tools/out/`.

`window.__showdownGamepad` is exposed on the page for debugging:
`.inject('RIGHT')`, `.enable(true)`, `.debug()`.

## Scope / non-goals (v1)

Battle controls, main menu and popups — no teambuilder, ladder or chat
navigation. No
remapping of the stick/d-pad axes (buttons remap in-page). Pads that don't
report `mapping === "standard"` are refused with a console warning rather than
guessed at. Classic client only; the `/beta` Preact client uses different
markup.

[`docs/dom-recon.md`](docs/dom-recon.md) (verified DOM facts) and
[`docs/ui-design.md`](docs/ui-design.md) (visual language and why).
